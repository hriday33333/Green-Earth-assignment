#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
*** Ans: 
var-----
Scope: Function-scoped. If declared inside a function, it is local to that function; if declared outside, itâ€™s global.
Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with undefined.
Re-declaration: Can be re-declared and updated within the same scope.
Use Case: Older code, but not recommended for modern development due to scoping issues.
